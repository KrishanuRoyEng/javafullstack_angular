Objects communicate via methods â€” this is like sending messages.
Relationships matter:
              Association: Objects know about each other.

              Aggregation: Objects are loosely connected.

              Composition: Objects are tightly connected (has-a).
              
Object interaction makes code modular, reusable, and closer to real-world modeling
