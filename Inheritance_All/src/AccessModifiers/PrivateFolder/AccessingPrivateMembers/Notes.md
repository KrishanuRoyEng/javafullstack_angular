### **Important Considerations**

1. **Encapsulation**: Private members enforce encapsulation by hiding implementation details
2. **Design Intent**: Using private signals that a member is for internal class use only
3. **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access and modification of sensitive data
4. **Maintainability**: Allows changing implementation without affecting subclasses
