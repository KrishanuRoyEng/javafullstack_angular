### **The Diamond Problem**

The Diamond Problem is a classic ambiguity that arises in programming languages that support multiple inheritance. Here's a breakdown of how it occurs:

1. **Inheritance Hierarchy:** The problem gets its name from the shape of the class diagram, which forms a diamond.
    - You have a superclass, **`A`**, at the top.
    - Two classes, **`B`** and **`C`**, inherit from class `A`.
    - Finally, a fourth class, **`D`**, attempts to inherit from both **`B`** and **`C`**.
2. **Method Overriding:**
    - Class `A` defines a method, for example, **`void print()`**.
    - Both class `B` and class `C` **override** this `print()` method to provide their own specific implementations.
3. **The Core Ambiguity:**
    - When class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`, it essentially receives **two different implementations** of the same `print()` method.
    - The compiler is now faced with a critical question: **Which version of the `print()` method should class `D` inherit?**
        - Should it use the one from `B`?
        - Or should it use the one from `C`?
4. **The Unresolvable Conflict:**
    - There is no logical or deterministic way for the compiler to choose one implementation over the other automatically.
    - This creates an **ambiguity** in the code, making its behavior unpredictable.
5. **Java's Design Choice:**
    - To completely avoid this ambiguity and maintain simplicity and reliability, the designers of Java made a deliberate choice: **a class cannot extend more than one other class**.
    - This means the code `class D extends B, C { }` is **invalid and will not compile** in Java.
6. **The Solution via Interfaces:**
    - Java provides an alternative using **interfaces**.
    - While a class can only extend one parent class, it can **implement multiple interfaces**.
    - Interfaces (until Java 8) could only declare methods, not implement them, thus avoiding the ambiguity. Since Java 8, interfaces can have `default` methods, but if a class implements two interfaces with the same default method, the **class is required to provide its own overriding implementation**, thus explicitly resolving the ambiguity.
