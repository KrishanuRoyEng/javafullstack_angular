This is a broad category where one object has a reference to another object. 
It's the most common relationship and is the basis for composition and aggregation.

Concept: A strong "whole-part" relationship where the part cannot exist without the whole. The lifecycle of the part is tightly controlled by the whole.

Keyword: new (the whole object creates the parts itself)
