The static keyword in Java is a fundamental modifier that belongs to the class rather than to any instance of the class. 

What is Static?
The static keyword creates class-level members that exist independently of any object instances. Static members are loaded into memory when the class is first loaded, before any objects are created.


Characteristics

Memory Management: Static members are stored in the method area (metaspace in newer JVM versions), not on the heap where instance variables reside

Initialization Timing: Static variables are initialized when the class is first loaded. Static blocks execute in the order they appear in the class.


Access Rules:
       Static methods can only directly access static variables and other static methods
       Static methods cannot use this or super keywords
       Non-static methods can access both static and non-static members
       
Inheritance: Static methods are not overridden but can be hidden. 
             If a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the parent class, 
             it hides the parent's method.
             
             
 Utility Classes: Classes like Math, Arrays, and Collections use static methods extensively.
